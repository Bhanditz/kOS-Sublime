kOS-Sublime
===========

Simple [Sublime 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) plugin to ease in creation of 
[KerboScript](https://github.com/Nivekk/KOS) files. It highlights most of the 
keywords and offers some completions.

Usage
=====

With Package Control, you can just Add Repository `https://github.com/EdvardM/kOS-Sublime`,
after which you should be able to install the package (Package Control / Install Package -> kos)
and that should be it - then all files ending with '.kos' or '.craft' use k-OS mode by default.
